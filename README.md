# HALF_adder

--> Generally in full adder, we have two inputs a and b with this we also have two outputs that shows the sum and carry of these inputs, as it's name it used for adding two bits.
--> For this i have used two popular softwares named as Modelsim and Quartus prime.
--> Actually the Modelsim is mainly used for to check the waveform and Quartus prime is mainly used for the Synthesis part and to write the code as well for further use in modelsim.
